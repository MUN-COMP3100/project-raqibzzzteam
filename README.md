### Restaurant Interface
a webapp that compiles all restauarants in an area. The webapp gives a detailed information on menu, reviews, popularity, delivery, discussion page, restaurant location
what backend and frontend might we need for this. Simple, and beginner friendly. Web app, node.js, javascript, etc. 



Backend:

1. Server-side: Node.js with Express for creating RESTful APIs that interact with the frontend.
2. Database: MongoDB for storing restaurant information, menus, reviews, and other relevant data.
3. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for implementing secure user authentication and authorization.
4. API integration: Yelp API for retrieving restaurant information, reviews, and menu items.

Frontend:
1. Client-side: React for creating dynamic user interfaces.
2. Map Integration: Google Maps API for displaying restaurant locations on the map.
3. UI/UX: Bootstrap or Material UI for designing responsive and user-friendly web pages.
4. HTTP client: Axios or Fetch API for making API requests to the server.

These technologies are beginner-friendly, widely used and have a large community and support to help with any questions or problems you may encounter.
