Project: St. John's Restaurant Finder
* There's been one too many times where you did not know where to go get food here in St. John's which is why we propose a small web application where users are able to view all their eating options in the city of St. John's based on only a few filters. Mood, rating, and cuisine type. Every Restaurant will have its own informations page where its location, menu, reviews and etc. will be displayed.
