Project: St. John's Restaurant Finder
* There's been one too many times where you did not kno where to go et food here in St. John's which is why we propose a small web application where users are able to view all their eating options in the city of St. John's. Every Restaurant will have its own informations page where its location, menu, reviews and etc. will be displayed.

### Project Feature Table

Fill the following table to list features that would be relevant to your concept of the project product. The column entries are as follows:

1. A short __name__ to refer to the feature
2. A brief __description__ of the feature in a sentence or less.
3. Which __end__ (server, client or both) is implicated in the coding needed. Try to break down features so they are primarily client-side (GUI, user interaction) or server-side (data manipulation, respond to user requests) where possible. Remember your server-side solution will be due first.
4. Do you plan to __deliver__  the feature as part of the project at the end of the course? (Yes, No or Maybe). _Maybe_ is for things you will try to deliver, but YES features will take precedence in terms of completing the project.
5. In the case of deliver=YES features, __who__ will be implementing the feature? One team member should be primarily responsible for the coding and delivery of the feature.
