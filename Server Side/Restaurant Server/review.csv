Restaurant,Review
Cojones,"Great spot to stop for a margarita on a rare, scorching hot and muggy afternoon in St. John's. Service was very friendly and efficient, the outdoor street-side patio was fun, and the margaritas - both the blueberry and the spicy mango - hit the spot. 5 stars."
Three Sisters Vietnamese Cuisine,"Great sandwiches, tons of flavour, drinks are great too"
Fabulous Foods,Hands down the best place for Turkey pie and fries dressing and gravy
NJ's Kitchen,"Delicious food, beautiful family-business staff, and very reasonably priced. Amazing selection of vegan and gluten free options - would highly recommend!"
