## Project Part 1, CS3100 W2023

## Instructions

Submit a group/team proposal for your term project.

Your project should be based on one of two data sets:

1. The mun course data from assignment 1. This project proposal would be an online student tool, for managing their course schedule.  You may get some ideas for features from the existing student tools at MUN, and think about additional features you would like to have, including integrations with other tools and other services.

2. The IMDB movie datasets available at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/. This proposal would be movie related, encompassing movie reviews, selection, and possibly integrating other features such as discussion chats or movie access or rental.  IMDB.com already has a wide range of online features available, so it would be most interesting to think of some project features they do not currently support.

If you want to work on a different project idea, you must get approval from the course instructor before submitting.

Your proposal should be submitted in your project repository before the due date and named `proposal.md`.  Markdown is the preferred format, but if your team does not know and does not have time to learn markdown, you may submit a pdf file `proposal.pdf` instead.

## Proposal Elements

Include the following sections in your proposal:

### Team

Team name: RakilloTeam
Team member 1: Anthony Racton, MUNID: araction, GITHUB: Rakillo  
Team member 2: Samnatha Larue, MUNID: slar223, GITHUB: starbaby23  
Project: mun course tool
* A project description goes here. Breifly elaborate on your conception of what the tool is for and the user community needs or wants that you might address. 

### Project Feature Table

Fill the following table to list features that would be relevant to your concept of the project product. The column entries are as follows:

1. A short __name__ to refer to the feature
2. A brief __description__ of the feature in a sentence or less.
3. Which __end__ (server, client or both) is implicated in the coding needed. Try to break down features so they are primarily client-side (GUI, user interaction) or server-side (data manipulation, respond to user requests) where possible. Remember your server-side solution will be due first.
4. Do you plan to __deliver__  the feature as part of the project at the end of the course? (Yes, No or Maybe). _Maybe_ is for things you will try to deliver, but YES features will take precedence in terms of completing the project.
5. In the case of deliver=YES features, __who__ will be implementing the feature? One team member should be primarily responsible for the coding and delivery of the feature.

|Name|Description|End|Deliver|Who|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Login|User login and profiles|Server|Yes|Rakillo
|Drag|Drag and drop courses onto schedule|Client|Yes|starbaby23
|Gird|A primary grid display of weekly schedule|Client|Yes|Rakillo
|Google|Synchronize with google calendar|Server|Maybe||

Try to balance the required coding effort between your team members. Each team member should have a substantial coding corpus to work on, to obtain appropriate marks in the course. 

You must have at least sixteen features in the Deliver=YES category, 
    * Within delivery=yes, eight feature for each of the Server and Client
        * Within each of server and client, four feature assigned to each team member

You should have another sixteen features in the Deliver=maybe or Deliver=no categories. These represent alternative or extra features that may be adopted if (a) you have time to complete more than the basic features (b) the marker feedback indicates that your plan is not ambitious enough, or (c) you need to adjust plans later on. 

### Description

You should elaborate on any of the features that are not self-explanatory, and particularly on Deliver=YES features so it is clear how extensive an implementation you anticipate. This will allow some idea of the coding effort involved. Use the feature names as sub-section headings to describe each feature. If you already know of a tool, module, library or express capability that will help your implementation you can include that information.

Also include User Interface sketches to illustrate your concept of the client-side web page user interface, in order to help explain your plans. You can scan free hand drawings if needed, but a sketch tool such as `figma.com` is recommended for producing clean GUI sketches.

Your proposal should be submitted in your project repository before the due date and named `proposal.md`.  Markdown is the preferred format, but if your team does not know and does not have time to learn markdown, you may submit a pdf file `proposal.pdf` instead.
